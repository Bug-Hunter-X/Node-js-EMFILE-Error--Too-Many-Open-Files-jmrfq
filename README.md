# Node.js EMFILE Error: Too Many Open Files

This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked Node.js error: 'EMFILE: too many open files'. This error arises when your server attempts to handle more concurrent requests than your operating system's file descriptor limit permits.  This example shows how to reproduce the error and implement solutions.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `npm install` (not necessary for this example, as no external dependencies are used).

## Reproduction

1. Run `node bug.js`.
2. Simultaneously send many requests to `http://localhost:3000` using tools like `ab` (Apache Benchmark) or a similar load testing tool. 
3. The error will likely manifest as the server fails to respond to some requests, showing the 'EMFILE' error in the console.

## Solution

Several strategies address this: 

* **Increase the file descriptor limit:** Adjust the OS's limit using the `ulimit` command (Linux/macOS) or the equivalent for your system.  This is often a temporary fix and might not scale well.
* **Improve request handling:** Use techniques like connection pooling (for database interactions), request throttling (to limit concurrent requests), or asynchronous operations to minimize the number of open file descriptors during a request's lifetime.  The provided `bugSolution.js` presents a basic example of asynchronous handling.

## Additional Notes

While this example focuses on HTTP servers, 'EMFILE' errors can appear in other Node.js applications that heavily utilize open files.
